Project: NFT Platform Landing Page
Author: Harsh Vardhan Sharma

Approach:- I built this project using a mobile-first philosophy but focused heavily on the desktop layout first due to the complexity of the grid. I strictly adhered to the "No Flexbox" rule, utilizing `display: grid` for all layout requirements, including one-dimensional rows like the navbar and footer.

Struggles:- The hardest part was managing the alignment of the Navigation bar and the Filter toggle switch using only CSS Grid, as Flexbox is usually the go-to tool for these specific align-items tasks.

Known Issues:
* The marquee strip animation in the footer is purely CSS-based and may not pause on hover.

Requirements Met:
1. Replicated design structure.
2. Used ONLY CSS Grid (No Flexbox).
3. Responsive (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
4. Hover interactions included.
5. Dark/Light mode implemented.
